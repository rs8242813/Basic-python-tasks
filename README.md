Task 1: Basic Mathematical Operations
Objective:  
The goal of this task is to build a simple Python program that takes two numbers as input and performs fundamental mathematical operations on them. This is useful for understanding how Python handles arithmetic and how user input can be processed dynamically.

Steps:  
1. The program will prompt the user to enter two numbers.
2. It will then perform the following operations:
   - Addition: Summing the two numbers.
   - Subtraction: Subtracting the second number from the first.
   - Multiplication: Multiplying both numbers.
   - Division: Dividing the first number by the second, but with a check to prevent division by zero.
3. The results will be displayed in a well-structured format.

Additional Features:  
- The program will include error handling to ensure that the user enters valid numbers.
- It will give a friendly response if the user attempts division by zero.

Real-World Use Case:  
This kind of program is the foundation of many applications, including calculators, financial systems, and basic data analysis tools.

Task 2: Personalized Greeting
Objective:  
The aim of this task is to create a friendly and interactive Python program that asks for the user’s name and then generates a personalized greeting.

Steps: 
1. The program will ask the user for their first and last name.
2. It will then combine both names into a full name.
3. The program will format the name properly (capitalizing where needed).
4. Finally, it will print a warm greeting message including the full name.

Additional Features:  
- The program ensures that spaces and extra characters don’t interfere with the output.
- The greeting message is designed to be friendly and engaging.

Real-World Use Case:  
Personalized greetings like this are commonly used in websites, applications, and chatbots to make interactions feel more human and welcoming.

Why These Tasks Matter?  
Both tasks introduce essential programming concepts:
- Task 1 focuses on handling numbers, user input, and error prevention.
- Task 2 teaches string manipulation, formatting, and enhancing user experience.
